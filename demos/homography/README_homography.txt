Roughly estimated 3-by-3 homographies are included for convenience. 
Each homography H provides a mapping from image coordinate to scene-dependent world coordinate.

[xw,yw,zw]' = H*[xi,yi,1]'

xi: horizontal axis on image with left top corner as origin, increases right.
yi: vertical axis on image with left top corner as origin, increases downward.

xw/zw: world x coordinate
yw/zw: world y coordiante
